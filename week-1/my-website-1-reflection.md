#### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

#### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

- Open the GitHub website and log in to your account
- From the "+" menu in the title bar, select "New Repository"
- On the creation page, to follow the DBC conventions, choose "Public Repository", "Add Readme", and under Add License, choose the "MIT License". 
- To clone the repository to your local computer, copy the HTTPS link from the text box shown on your new repository's page. 
- Use the command line ("cd path/to/directory") on your local computer to navigate to the directory where you'd like to place the clone. 
- Type "git clone [HTTPS url you copied]". 

#### Describe what open source means.

Open source signifies that the software developers have chosen to share the code they used to create the software, rather than just releasing the machine-readable output of that code. Since the code is visible, anyone may modify or improve the software to suit their needs, and it can no longer be completely protected as proprietary. Still, the developers may set limits on its use by assigning a license to it. 

#### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think that Open Source is a terrific option for software development, whether it is chosen strategically or altruistically. Strategically speaking, choosing to make a core product open source can encourage wide adoption and a broad community of volunteer contributors, and this ubiquity can both improve the product and create a wider market for associated paid services, like support or hosting. Altruistically, the Open Source option points to the belief that the benefits of what the world can create together outweigh the costs of losing potential profit on sales of a proprietary product. In this way, Open Source can be a foundational principle against corporate greed and competition in the software development space. 

Personally, the whole Open Source concept makes me feel neither nervous nor protective; there seems to be room for Open Source alongside traditional closed-source solutions, and the developers and business should choose a model that fits their intentions on a case-by-case basis. I certainly can support the ideal of free, greed-less sharing of all intellectual property, but realistically, I understand that current structures don't necessarily always support that. 

#### Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses can protect a piece of open source software from becoming used in a manner vastly separate from the developer's intention. They can be used to ensure that the project will always remain open source, for instance, or they can be used to officially declare that the project can be used and modified and sold in any way, without restriction. 

#### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I learned a lot more about the meaning of "Open Source," a term which until now had been a vague descriptor of non-proprietary software. I also was able to go through the branch/push/pull-request/merge/branch-deletion workflow without consulting the instructions. I went through a lot of the material on the linked "Sublime Text perfect workflow" tutorial, and I certainly think that the gradual use and mastery of the keyboard shortcuts in SublimeText will save a lot of time and also make the coding process zippy and enjoyable. I have a feeling that a lot of coding success has to do with being able to communicate ideas textually as close to the speed of thought as possible, and keyboard shortcuts in SublimeText will assist that. I also appreciated learning how easy it is to get a static site published on GitHub Pages. 


#### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I consulted SublimeText's [Package Control website](http://packagecontrol.io) for installing some plugins, including a Markdown preview utility, and a [Markdown syntax document](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

I explored all the linked pages in the assignment, of course, but paid particular attention to the [SublimeText perfect workflow](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course--net-27293) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
