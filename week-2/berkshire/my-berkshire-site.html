<!-- 

- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was fairly straightforward. My pair and I had different levels of prior HTML experience, and I was pretty confident that I knew what to do. The process for me was more about helping my pair work through the questions of how the document should be structured. This was still beneficial for me since it forced me to think clearly and methodically about my prior knowledge, which will come in handy if I ever am privileged to teach code to others. All that said, it's still just as satisfying as ever to construct the markup code and see the successful product loaded in the web browser-- there's a sense that you've created a well-ordered, semantically organized document.  

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I had mostly learned HTML while it was still more common to use the HTML 4.0 specification, so I really enjoyed learning and thinking about the new elements introduced in HTML5, like <section>, <aside>, <article>, etc. It's interesting how the markup has evolved to suit how people actually use the web. Also, HTML is extremely well-documented on the internet, so when we were wondering exactly how to make an image, for example, it was as simple as googling "html image". 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

My pair and I discussed the philosophy of separating content/semantics from display and how HTML is ideally intended only for the former. There wasn't much display to mimic on the Berkshire Hathaway site to begin with, but we understood the principles nonetheless. We did discuss this topic when we added the <hr> element, which is an element that renders as a line, which perhaps should be created using a CSS border instead. Still, it could be argued that <hr> has semantic value as a hard section separator, perhaps indicating a stronger separation in content than a <section> tag or <div>. 

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

The good is how, when used purely semantically, it can really organize a document and its pieces. It also structures well visually when proper indentation is used. It's a good middle ground between human- and machine-readability. The only possible bad thing I can think of is that it requires a lot of < and > and / characters, which can be a little cluttered. Perhaps we will one day simplify the formatting and syntax standards of HTML to take more meaning from spacing and indentation, rather than characters like <> and </>. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I usually write the closing tag immediately after writing the opening tag, and then I move the cursor backward into the area between them. This helps me to not forget to close the elements that I open. I also try to think of the elements by their full names (i.e., "list item" rather than "L.I.")... this is easier to remember than trying to memorize arbitrary two-letter codes.
