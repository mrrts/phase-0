# Create results array, which will be an array of group arrays
# Iterate through names master list array with indexes
# Push each name into array to hold the small group
# If the index+1 is divisible by 4
# 	The array is finished
#   Push the array into the results array
# If the final group array has fewer than 3 people
#  	Put the first person into the second-to-last group
#  	Put the second person (if there is one) into the third-to-last group
# Return the results array 
# Perhaps make a results hash that has "Group 1" as the key, and the group array as the value
