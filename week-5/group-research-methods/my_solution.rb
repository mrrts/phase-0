# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# At first I used delete plus an if statement, but then I found that arrays and hashes also have
# a "delete_if" method that accepts a block and deletes the item, or the key-value pair, if the 
# expression in the block evaluates to "true".

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
#
#
#


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
