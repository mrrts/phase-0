// PERSON 2: 

// (Pseudocode based on only reading Person 1's User stories)




// Define an array filled with only even numbers of your choosing
// Define an array filled with only odd numbers of your choosing


// Create a function named sum that accepts an array of integers as an argument
// and Returns the sum of the integers in the array
// 	- Declare a new variable as the running sum, set equal to zero
// 	- FOR each integer in the argument array, add it to the running sum variable
// 	- Return the running sum variable 

// Call the sum function with the even-numbers array passed in 
// Call the sum function with the odd-numbers array passed in 




// Create a function named average that accepts an array of integers as an argument 
// and returns the average of all the integers in the array 
// 	- Call your new sum function with the argument array passed in to find its sum, and save the sum into a variable 
// 	- Divide the sum of the argument array by the its length to find the average
// 	- Return this average 

// Call the average function with the even-numbers array passed in 
// Call the average function with the odd-numbers array passed in 




// Create a function median that accepts an array of integers as an argument 
// and returns the median of all the integers in the array 
// 	- IF the length of the array is even (even number of integers)
// 		- Find the middlemost pair of numbers by dividing the length by 2 and using the result as the index for one of the numbers and the result-minus-1 as the index for the other
// 		- Create an array with those two middlemost values
// 		- Return the average of the two middlemost values (use the previously defined average function)
// 	- ELSE (the length of the array is odd)
// 		- Find the middle value by dividing the length by 2 and using the result, rounded down, as the index
// 		- Return that middle value 

// Call the median function with the even-numbers array passed in 
// Call the median function with the odd-numbers array passed in
