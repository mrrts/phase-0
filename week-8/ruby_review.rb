# Cipher Challenge

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing.
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

# def dr_evils_cipher(coded_message)
#   input = coded_message.downcase.split("") # Check out this method in IRB to see how it works! Also refer to the Ruby docs.
#   decoded_sentence = []
#   cipher = {"e" => "a",   # This is technically a shift of four letters...Can you think of a way to automate this? Is a hash
#             "f" => "b",   # the best data structure for this problem? What are the pros and cons of hashes?
#             "g" => "c",
#             "h" => "d",

# Reflection
# Keep your reflection limited to 10-15 minutes!

# --- What concepts did you review or learn in this challenge?

# I iterated over a string using each_char for the first time, instead of splitting the string into an array and iterating
# over the array. I also needed to rely on negative numbers as array indices, since the alphabet array needed to cycle
# back onto itself if the offset took you further back than the letter 'a'. 


# --- What is still confusing to you about Ruby?

# Well, at this point, I do not know what I do not know, but everything in the curriculum for Ruby is pretty clear to 
#   me at this point. 


# --- What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?

# I am submitting this single review exercise in order to officially finish the assignment, but I hope to find time to do all of the Ruby review challenges and add them into this file. I also hope to study some more Javascript. I would
#   like to challenge myself to work out some more Javascript challenges, perhaps another game or two.
